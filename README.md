You are a Digital Marketing Analyst who has been given the task of creating an interactive tool to analyze 
the effectiveness of product placement strategies. For this project, you will use R and the Shiny package to develop
an application that allows users to input their own data and assess the impact of product ad placements on click- through rates (CTR) on a website.

The application should allow users to enter data for three different ad placement locations: left sidebar, center page, 
and right sidebar. Each ad location should be considered for its CTR performance. Reflect on whether the findings from this analysis 
could be applicable to other forms of digital advertisements across various website layouts.


Project Instructions:

1.	Use R Shiny to create an interactive web application.
2.	Your application should include:
-	Text input or file upload options to enter data for CTRs by ad placement location.
-	The ability to perform statistical analysis within the app to determine if there is a significant difference in CTRs by ad placement.
-	Visualizations (such as bar charts or boxplots) that display CTR performance by ad placement location.
-	A summary output that communicates the results of the statistical analysis, including the p-value
-	and whether the results are statistically significant at a 0.05 level of significance.
3.	In your application, include an example dataset based on the CTR data provided in the exam question and ensure that the app can analyze this default dataset.
4.	Write a guide that explains how to use the application and interpret the results.
5.	Discuss potential limitations of the application and how it could be adapted for analyzing the effectiveness of other digital marketing strategies beyond ad placement.

Reflection Question:
How could the insights gained from this application inform a digital marketerâ€™s strategy for ad placements on
different types of websites or digital platforms?
